    <h2 class="article-header">4D EXPLORATION</h2>
    <div class="main-content">
      <p>Now that we have a basic understanding of the fourth dimension, where do we go from here?</p>
      <p>For starters, there's plenty to discover by playing with the concepts we already understand. Like did you know rotating a 3D object on a 4D plane allows you to completely flip the 3D object? Rotate this 3D cube to 180Â° on the ZW plane to see what I mean:</p>
      <SceneButtonSingle :sceneID="scenes.three.rotateCubeIn4D" :text="'LOAD SCENE'" :imgName="'flip_4d.png'"></SceneButtonSingle>
      <p>This means if your body rotated through the fourth dimension, youâ€™d come back with your heart on the right side of your body instead of the left O_O A similar flip occurs when rotating a 2D object through the third dimension.</p>
      <!-- <SceneButtonSingle :sceneID="scenes.threeandcanvas.squareSlice" :text="'LOAD SCENE'" :imgName="'slice_cube.png'"></SceneButtonSingle> -->
      <img class="img-wide" src="~assets/flip_square.gif" alt="Left and right side of square being mirrored after rotation on XZ plane">
      <p>Hereâ€™s another pleasing discovery: A being with 4D vision would have a perfect view of everything inside our bodies. This is equivalent to a 3D human seeing the inside of a solid 2D shape, while a 2D being could only see the shape's boundary.</p>
      <img class="img-wide" src="~assets/see_insides.png" alt="Showing square from 3D perspective and 2D perspective">
      <p>But how would light get into our insides? Would the 4D being have a 4D flashlight that could light each atom in our body simultanously? This is where you can start to ask all the more specific questions about how a 4D being would sense their world and what their laws of physics would look like.</p>
      <p>Like would the beingâ€™s eyes detect 3D images and their brain then process them into 4D mental images? What would a 4D shape look like when shaded by a 4D light? Could you get pulled along the w axis by a 4D being? If you could then what would you see? Remember, asking the equivalent questions for 2D and 3D can help a lot with answering these 4D questions.</p>
      <p>Outside of questioning what you already know, other methods can help dig even deeper into the fourth dimension.</p>
      <p>First as a PSA, let me assure you that an expensive VR/3D headset probably wonâ€™t help much. A VR headset makes us better at viewing the 3rd dimension. If you can already use a 2D image to accurately imagine a 3D shape in your head, then VR wonâ€™t provide any new information. However, if a VR game allows you to physically interact with 4D shapes in a way you canâ€™t on a regular phone/computer, <i>then</i> you could start gaining some new insights.</p>
      <p>If you know how to code and want to learn how to program the 3D representations of 4D shapes used on this website, the source code is available on <a href="https://github.com/baileysnyder/4dvisualizer" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.</p>
      <p>There are also plenty of other representations of 4D objects you can find or create yourself. Maybe instead of perspective projection you use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereographic_projection" target="_blank">stereographic projection</a>. Perhaps you unfold the object into a 3D <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesseract#Net" target="_blank">net</a>. Maybe you represent the 4D object as a series of connected 3D <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetrahedron" target="_blank">tetrahedron</a>, the same way 3D objects are split up into 2D triangles in computer graphics.</p>

      <p>Thereâ€™s always more to learn, but at this point youâ€™ve got a pretty solid overview of the fourth dimension. Remember your basic 4D shapes and to always consider an equivalent 3D to 2D scenario and youâ€™re basically set. Now that you have an extra dimension at your disposal, anything is possible ðŸ‘½</p>
